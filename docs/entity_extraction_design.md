# Entity Extraction Module Design

## Overview

The entity extraction module is designed to identify, extract, and store named entities from various content types ingested into the system. Entities include people, organizations, locations, dates, and other domain-specific items that can be used for content analysis, search, and retrieval.

## Integration Points

1. **Content Processors**: The entity extraction module integrates with the existing content processors to analyze processed content before storage.

2. **Claude AI**: For advanced entity recognition, the module leverages Claude AI via the existing API integration.

3. **Database Storage**: Extracted entities are stored in the existing `entities` and `content_entities` tables.

## Module Components

### 1. Core Entity Extraction (`entity_extractors.sh`)

This module provides the main functions for entity extraction:

- **Initialization**: Setup and configuration of entity extractors
- **Entity Extraction Router**: Routes content to appropriate extractor based on content type
- **Entity Storage Functions**: Functions to save and retrieve entities from the database
- **Entity Normalization**: De-duplicates and normalizes entity names and types

### 2. Content-Specific Extractors

These components handle different content types:

- **Text Entity Extractor**: Processes plain text and markdown
- **Document Entity Extractor**: Processes PDFs and other document formats
- **Code Entity Extractor**: Extracts entities from source code (functions, classes, etc.)
- **Image Entity Extractor**: Uses Claude AI to identify entities in images
- **Video Entity Extractor**: Extracts entities from video metadata and frames

### 3. Claude AI Integration

Uses Claude AI for advanced entity extraction:

- **Prompt Templates**: Specialized prompts for entity extraction by content type
- **Response Parsing**: Functions to parse Claude's JSON responses into entity data structures
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Secondary extraction methods when Claude API is unavailable

## Workflow

1. Content is processed by the content processors module
2. The entity extraction module receives the processed content
3. The entity router selects the appropriate extractor for the content type
4. Entities are extracted using rules-based approaches or Claude AI
5. Extracted entities are normalized and de-duplicated
6. Entities are stored in the database with links to their source content

## Entity Types and Structure

The system will extract and categorize these entity types:

- **Person**: Individual names (e.g., "John Smith")
- **Organization**: Companies, institutions, groups (e.g., "Anthropic")
- **Location**: Physical places (e.g., "San Francisco") 
- **Date/Time**: Temporal references (e.g., "January 2025")
- **Product**: Product names (e.g., "Claude")
- **Technology**: Technical terms and concepts (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence")
- **Event**: Named events (e.g., "World Economic Forum")
- **Other**: Domain-specific entities that don't fit other categories

## Data Structures

Entities will be represented using this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Entity name",
  "type": "person|organization|location|date|product|technology|event|other",
  "mentions": [
    {
      "context": "Surrounding text or context of the mention",
      "position": "Line number or position in content",
      "relevance": 0.85  // Confidence score from 0 to 1
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    // Additional entity-specific information
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Chunking**: Large documents will be processed in chunks to prevent memory issues
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed entities will be cached to reduce database load
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Entity extraction can run asynchronously for large content
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple entities will be stored in batches to reduce database operations
- **Database Indexing**: Specialized indexes for entity tables to improve query performance
  - Composite index for entity type and name to optimize entity lookups
  - Index on entity creation date for chronological filtering
  - Multiple indexes on content_entities table for efficient relationship queries
  - Automatic index application during database initialization

## Error Handling

- **Invalid Content**: Skip extraction with appropriate logging
- **API Failures**: Fall back to rule-based extraction when Claude API fails
- **Storage Failures**: Cache entities in memory and retry storage later

## Future Extensions

- **Relationship Extraction**: Identify relationships between entities
- **Entity Disambiguation**: Resolve ambiguous entity references
- **Customizable Entity Types**: Allow users to define custom entity types
- **Entity Verification**: Verify extracted entities against external knowledge bases
