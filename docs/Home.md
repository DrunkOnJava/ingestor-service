# Ingestor System Wiki

Welcome to the Ingestor System wiki! This wiki provides comprehensive documentation for the Ingestor System, a powerful tool for content ingestion, processing, and entity extraction.

## Overview

The Ingestor System is designed to efficiently process various types of content (text, code, images, PDFs, etc.), extract structured entities, and make them available for search and analysis. It provides a modular, extensible architecture that can be customized for different use cases.

## Key Features

- **Content Processing**: Process multiple content types with specialized handlers
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract structured entities from various content sources
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently handle large volumes of content using parallel processing
- **API Interface**: RESTful API for integration with other systems
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for interactive use and scripting
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI integration
- **Structured Logging**: Detailed, configurable logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Performance Profiling**: Tools for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks

## System Architecture

The Ingestor System follows a modular architecture with these main components:

- **Core Engine**: Manages the ingestion workflow and coordinates all components
- **Content Processors**: Specialized processors for different content types
- **Entity Extractors**: Components that identify and extract entities from content
- **Storage Layer**: Manages persistent storage of content and extracted entities
- **API Layer**: Provides REST API access to system capabilities
- **CLI Layer**: Command-line interface for system operation

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Follow the [installation instructions](Installation) to set up the system
2. **Configuration**: Configure the system using the [configuration guide](Configuration)
3. **Basic Usage**: Learn about [basic usage](Basic-Usage) of the system
