# Security Alert: Dependency Vulnerabilities

## Summary

The weekly dependency scan has detected vulnerabilities in project dependencies.

## Vulnerability Report

- **Total vulnerabilities:** {{ env.VULNERABILITIES }}
- **High/Critical vulnerabilities:** {{ env.HIGH_VULNERABILITIES }}

## Details

See the [latest dependency scan workflow]({{ env.WORKFLOW_URL }}) for detailed information about the vulnerabilities.

## Recommended Actions

1. [ ] Review the vulnerability report in the workflow artifacts
2. [ ] Run `npm audit` locally to view detailed information
3. [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix  # For minor version updates
   npm audit fix --force  # For major version updates (may break compatibility)
   ```
4. [ ] If direct updates are not possible, evaluate and implement alternative solutions:
   - Use a different package
   - Implement security measures to mitigate the vulnerability
   - Pin to a specific version known to be safe
5. [ ] Run tests after updating dependencies to ensure compatibility
6. [ ] Document any decisions to accept specific vulnerabilities with justification

## Priority

{{ env.HIGH_VULNERABILITIES > 0 && 'ğŸ”´ High: Contains high/critical vulnerabilities that should be addressed immediately.' || 'ğŸŸ¡ Medium: Contains only low/moderate vulnerabilities that should be addressed in the next release cycle.' }}
